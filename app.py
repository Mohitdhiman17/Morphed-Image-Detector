            ### Welcome to the Image Tampering Detector!
            **What This Project Does:**
            This tool helps you determine whether an image has been altered or manipulated. Try it out and see if your images hold up under scrutiny!

with st.expander("How it Works?"):
    st.markdown("""
There are two parallels that are being used to identify an image's authenticity:

1. **Error Level Analysis (ELA):**
   - Images that are edited often show different compression artifacts compared to the original ones. ELA highlights these discrepancies, making tampering visible.

    # Create columns for horizontal layout
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

    # Display ELA images in columns
    with col1:
        st.image("rsc/real.jpg", caption="ELA of a Real Image", use_column_width=True)

    with col2:
        st.image("rsc/fake.jpg", caption="ELA of a Tampered Image", use_column_width=True)

    st.markdown("""
    Notice how ELA on real image shows consistency across the image but on fake image, ELA shows discrepancy across some regions.
                
    2. **Weather Validation:**
        - **Purpose:** Weather Validation examines the metadata embedded in the image to cross-check if the depicted weather conditions are consistent with historical weather data from the image's recorded location and time.
        - **How?:**
            Images often contain metadata that includes information about the location, date, and time when the image was taken.
            Using this metadata, historical weather databases are queried to retrieve the weather conditions for the recorded location and date.
            Then actual weather conditions in the image are compared (as identified by a Weather CNN model) with the historical data to determine if they match.
        - **Why It Matters:** This helps in verifying the authenticity of outdoor images by ensuring that the weather depicted matches what was recorded historically for that location and time. Discrepancies can indicate tampering or misrepresentation.

    1. **Upload an Image:** Choose an image to analyze.
